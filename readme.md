My name is Ihor Zenich. I'm living in Kharkiv, Ukraine.  
I'm known as author of [HTML5Checklist](https://github.com/ihorzenich/html5checklist), co-author of [CSS-methodologies "101" examples](https://github.com/aleshaOleg/holy-grail-markup) and [BEM evangelist](http://ihorzenich.github.io/talks/bem-css/).

This AMA is a good place to ask me personal or work-related questions.
Ask me anything! 
Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.
